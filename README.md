# Marvelous Realm of Eärndayl

January 2024: this project is a work in progress. The *Marvelous Realm of Eärndayl* is also a working title, inspired by "The Wonderful World of Eamon", a game I played as a kid.

## License

I wrote the bulk of the code in this repository from scratch, but with many ideas inspired by Ruud Helderman <r.helderman@hccnet.nl> and his excellent example of a text adventure in C. For example, my parser follows the same approach that he used (I found the A-Z buffer  clever) but my implementation of the parser has little or no code in common. Nonetheless, I have extended the MIT License and gratefully credit his work. It was what excited me to work on the project in the first place, and parts of the project gleefully derive directly from his code.
